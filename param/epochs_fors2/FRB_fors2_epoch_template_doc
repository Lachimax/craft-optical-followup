# I've left this here as documentation of what each of these parameters actually represent; because of the way the code
# here is written, changing this to an actual .yaml file will result in comments being wiped out, which is not ideal.
# f stands for filter, and stands in for whichever filters you have for this field. Any parameter here beginning with
# an f_  requires a separate instance for each filter used. The pipeline should populate these automatically.

astrometry_tweak: # Do a tweak of the astrometry solution of the image using the stars in the image against a catalogue.
cat_field_name: # Name of the catalogue to use for comparison.
data_dir: # Directory in which the epoch is stored.
deepest_filter: # Filter to use for detection in SExtractor double image mode.
des_cat: # Directory of DES catalogue for this field, in csv format.
do_dual_mode: # Whether to do SExtractor in dual-mode; leave as False when not all filters have the same number of exposures.
do_sextractor: # Whether to do SExtractor analysis
filters: # A list of the filters in which the data has been taken.
f_cat_calib_path: # Path to a SExtractor catalogue taken from another FORS2 epoch of the same image; only necessary if you wish to use the other epoch for calibration.
f_cat_calib_zeropoint: # Zeropoint to apply to the above catalogue.
f_cat_calib_zeropoint_err: # Error in the above quantity.
f_colour_term: # % Colour term of the f-band FRB field image.
f_colour_term_err: # % Uncertainty in the above.
f_des_fits: # Path to DES cutout image.
f_des_sextractor_psf: # Path to final psf-fit SExtractor catalogue of DES cutout.
f_do_zeropoint_field: # & f_do_zeropoint_field; Whether to do a zeropoint - kX determination directly on the observed field. Requires a catalogue of that field with a psf-fit magnitude column.
f_field_mag_range_lower: # The lower magnitude limit of the objects to include in zeropoint determination.
f_field_mag_range_upper: #  The upper magnitude limit of the objects to include in zeropoint determination.
f_std_mag_range_lower: # The lower magnitude limit of the objects to include in zeropoint determination using standard field.
f_std_mag_range_upper: # The upper magnitude limit of the objects to include in zeropoint determination using standard field.
f_std_star_class_tol: # Tolerance on class_star parameter to allow when deriving zeropoint from standard image.
gaia_cat: # Directory of GAIA catalogue for this field, in csv format.
sextractor_kron_radius: # Kron radius to use for mag_auto determination in SExtractor (see SExtractor documentation)
skip_astrometry: # Skip correction using astrometry.net; useful for re-running, as this step takes a while.
skip_copy: # Skip copying the data to the esoreflex directory; useful for re-running, as this step takes a while.
skip_download: # Skip downloading the data from the ESO server; use if you already have the data locally.
sm_cat: # Directory of SkyMapper catalogue for this field, in csv format.
sm_fits: # Directory to SkyMapper cutout
std_cat: # Catalogue for use with standard field
std_cat_name: # Name of catalogue for use with standard field.
threshold: # Threshold value to feed to SExtractor's DETECT_THRESH and ANALYSIS_THRESH arguments.
