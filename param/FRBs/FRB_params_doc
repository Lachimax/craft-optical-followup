# I've left this here as documentation of what each of these parameters actually represent; because of the way the code
# here is written, changing this to an actual .yaml file will result in comments being wiped out, which is not ideal.
# f stands for filter, and stands in for whichever filters you have for this field. Any parameter here beginning with
# an f_ will require a separate instance for each filter used.

# ! = need to make the pipeline write this.
# % = not currently used.
# & = Requires adjustment in pipeline for clarity.
