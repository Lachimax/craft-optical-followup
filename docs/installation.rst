Installation
============

Prequisites
-----------

Some packages are not required for primary functionality but are necessary for certain features.

* `FRB <https://github.com/FRBs/FRB>`_ is used by :class:`craftutils.observation.objects.FRB` for some modelling to do with FRB propagation.

Installing
----------

Currently, the best way to install this package is to clone it from GitHub and then use
``pip`` to install it.

#. Clone from https://github.com/Lachimax/craft-optical-followup.git

#. Open a terminal in the directory in which you have cloned it.

#. Install:
    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install .

    Or, if you want to edit the code while installed::

        pip install -e .

I may add the package to the Python Package Index (PyPI) at some point in order to streamline installation, but haven't yet.
